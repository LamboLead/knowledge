# Ideas
- Set this note as a hierarchy of other notes.
- Try to replicate the structure that you had in the previous note-taking system.
- Set the main note as the introduction to the topic, and put a table of contents inside of it.
> Tip: Put links to each note so that is easier to navigate through all the knowledge.
